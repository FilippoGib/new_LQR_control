# lqr

This node is ONLY the LQR algorithm to compute the steering and the throttle the car should actuate in order to follow a given path.

This node can be use effectively to control the simulated car on the Assetto Corsa simulator.

This node is NOT a control_node yet, it does not have the capability to control the actual car as it does not interface with real actuators.
